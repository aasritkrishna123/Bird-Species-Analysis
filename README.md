# 🐦 Bird Species Observation Analysis – Python & Power BI

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing bird species observation data** using **Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Power BI for interactive visualization**. The aim is to understand **species distribution, observation patterns, habitat trends, and biodiversity insights** to support ecological research and conservation-oriented decision-making.

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end analytics workflow**, combining data science techniques with business-style dashboards.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze **bird species diversity and distribution**
* Identify **most frequently observed species**
* Understand **location-wise and time-based observation trends**
* Study **habitat and environmental patterns** affecting observations
* Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for insight exploration

---

## 📦 Dataset Description

The dataset contains bird observation records with attributes such as:

* **Species Name**
* **Observation Location / Region**
* **Observation Date / Time**
* **Habitat Type**
* **Observation Count / Frequency**
* **Environmental Indicators** (where applicable)

This data enables biodiversity analysis and trend-based ecological insights.
